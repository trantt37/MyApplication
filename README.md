Individual Assignment 4 Part 2 Instructions

I have uploaded my Android App to our classroom repository: https://github.com/CMSC-355-Spring-18/MyApplication.  You may use my code as a starting point.  I blended fragments and activities together. Make sure you fork from this file before starting your work.

The app you are to write consists of three screens: 1) a Welcome screen and 2) an EnterValues screen, and 3) a Results screen.

When starting the app, the user is presented with the Welcome screen, containing a TextView
widget that displays the message ”Find synonym/antonym”, a Plain Text field where the user can enter a word and two buttons labeled ”Enter Values” and “Find Synonym/Antonym”. When the ”Enter Values” button is clicked, the EnterValues screen is displayed.

The EnterValues screen has two Plain Text fields with appropriate TextView fields as labels, and a ”Submit” Button. The text fields will allow you to enter a synonym/antonym pair, and the ”Submit” Button enters the pair into the SQLite Database, and returns you to the Welcome screen.

On the Welcome screen, if the user enters a word into the Plain Text field and clicks the button “Find Synonym/Antonym”, the Results screen will appear.  If the word matches a synonym/antonym pair, the synonym/antonym is returned.  If not, the message “Word not found” is displayed.

Submission via Git:
Your finished code should be uploaded to a GitHub repository by the deadline.  Commit and push incremental revisions to the Android app to your repository. Check using the Web
interface that all is well with your repository before the deadline.



To submit your assignment, post in Blackboard 
•	The URL for your GitHub repository
•	A screen shot of the screens in your application as you test your code.
